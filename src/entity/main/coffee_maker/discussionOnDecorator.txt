Decorator Design Pattern:
    Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing
    object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes
    under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing
    class.

If we do not use decorator to the CoffeeMaker, we would have a very deep
inheritance tree from coffee to decaf to decafWithMilk...
And milk, mocha and soy are not kind of coffee but we may want to add them
into coffee

Consider base class as canvas, decorator is to add something into this
canvas layer by layer
