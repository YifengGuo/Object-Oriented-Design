How to determine a game is a draw?
    Solution1: Both players submit a request for draw

    Solution2: count the duplicate steps and if it reaches the limit, call a draw

    Solution3: record the total count of steps, if total steps reach the MAX_STEPS, call a draw

        Solution 3 is better because Solution1 needs detailed design on class Player
                                     Solution2 needs to remember too much info in the past
