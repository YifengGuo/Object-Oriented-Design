Restaurant:
    input  --->          Restaurant   --->      Output

  a group of people                              table


We could also discuss:
                     input and output pair:
                        order   --->    dishes
                     order type:
                        delivery, pick-ups, dine-in...


Table type:
    Bar
    normal table     ======>    type will affect max number of people, price
    private room


Here we simply first consider normal table (no reservation, no dine-out)

We better consider the design from the system-side
So we had better do not consider to much on person!!

Compare:
        List<Guest>
        Party
    first choice would invoke class Guest, and would need a Party class which holds List<Guest>

    So basically, we better consider the design from object oriented way without considering too much details

    Party --->  Restaurant   ---> Table

    Party ---> orderDish()  Restaurant ---> return a table of dishes

    Party ---> pay()        Restaurant ---> clearTable()
